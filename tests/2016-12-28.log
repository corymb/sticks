[01:11:15] <kosh> hmm it seems my problem is ill-conditioned and matlab has a lot of work done for numerical stabilization that scipy and most other libraries just don't have
[02:24:58] <toddpratt> kosh u crazy

[03:39:11] <kosh> toddpratt, we already know that part
[03:39:20] <kosh> toddpratt, but it does not change that the condition number of my matrix is about 1e11
[03:41:21] <toddpratt> i care nothing for your matrices
[03:41:30] <kosh> that is okay
[03:41:34] <kosh> you don't have to solve them
[03:44:53] <deniska> The matrix has you
[03:44:59] <kosh> hehe
[03:48:16] <toddpratt> kosh lives in a brain-damage psychosis induced sort-of matrix
[03:51:46] <kosh> and toddpratt is an expert on the effects of brain-damage through vast personal experience :)

[04:06:13] <toddpratt> no?
[04:06:22] <Pici> python?
[04:06:27] <toddpratt> kosh: sadly, that is true
[04:06:29] <wleslie> a tiny bit of bikeshedding, but oddly satisfying
[04:10:22] <toddpratt> kosh: a neurologist suggested I have CTE
[04:10:31] <wleslie> is it a recursive CTE
[04:10:55] <toddpratt> but the only way to diagnose it positively is via autopsy
[04:11:09] <toddpratt> that's unhelpful
[04:11:11] <Pici> from what?
[04:11:20] <wleslie> life
[04:11:28] <Pici> I know what an autopsy is.
[04:11:44] <wleslie> "banging your head against a wall
[04:11:45] <wleslie> "
[04:12:13] <toddpratt> various head injuries
[04:12:23] <Pici> :/
[04:12:27] <toddpratt> weren't no bike helmets in the '80s
[04:13:09] <wleslie> oh.  sorry toddpratt.  that's sucky.
[04:13:21] <toddpratt> if there were, my mom would probably be like, "I'm not buying you any more.  You just keep breaking them."
[04:25:49] <wleslie> I can't tell if my blue cheese has gone moldy
[04:39:46] <kosh> toddpratt, that is okay I am willing to cut open your head to see where the problem is
[05:12:13] <toddpratt> yes
[05:12:37] <toddpratt> kosh: when?
[05:13:39] <toddpratt> not recently
[05:13:42] <toddpratt> damn
[05:15:02] <kosh> well there are probably going to be some side effects
[05:15:51] <toddpratt> i knew you'd lose your nerve
[05:16:11] <kosh> I also don't live remotely near you

[05:25:23] <ldlework> New favorite past time: Hyping VR to all my gamer friends who are also parents.
[05:25:38] <kosh> why parents?
[05:31:26] <kosh> hmm games "journalists" are very strange it seems they keep saying that elder scrolls 6 will be out next year or that it won't be out and all kinds of reasons why
[05:31:55] <kosh> and bethesda flat out said it was still in design phase and was in design phase since shortly after fallout 4 and it will be another few years before it comes out since it takes a long time to write these games
[05:36:39] <Jerub> is the daydream vr thing any good?
[05:42:12] <Pici> kosh: which "journalists" are you listening to?
[05:42:34] <kosh> just some random stuff I have run into over time
[05:42:57] <kosh> google will suggest stories I might be interested in, I click on it and realize it is utter crap and then use this addon to block that source

[06:57:13] <ldlework> kosh, just because they are usually on the fence due to various reasons
[06:57:17] <ldlework> so they are the most fun to hypse
[06:57:28] <ldlework> schadenfreude or whatever its called
[06:58:53] <ldlework> I must say though, Google Earth VR gives me VR sickness like no other game
[06:59:02] <ldlework> I have to remember to do that one in small doses
[07:17:56] <kosh> I will wait on VR for probably fallout 4 VR if it gets good reviews
[07:18:05] <kosh> my next laptop will be VR capable
