[01:11:15] <kosh> hmm it seems my problem is ill-conditioned and matlab has a lot of work done for numerical stabilization that scipy and most other libraries just don't have

[03:39:11] <kosh> toddpratt, we already know that part
[03:39:20] <kosh> toddpratt, but it does not change that the condition number of my matrix is about 1e11
[03:41:21] <toddpratt> i care nothing for your matrices
[03:41:30] <kosh> that is okay
[03:41:34] <kosh> you don't have to solve them
[03:44:53] <deniska> The matrix has you
[03:44:59] <kosh> hehe
[03:48:16] <toddpratt> kosh lives in a brain-damage psychosis induced sort-of matrix
[03:51:46] <kosh> and toddpratt is an expert on the effects of brain-damage through vast personal experience :)

[04:06:27] <toddpratt> kosh: sadly, that is true
[04:06:29] <wleslie> a tiny bit of bikeshedding, but oddly satisfying
[04:10:22] <toddpratt> kosh: a neurologist suggested I have CTE
[04:10:31] <wleslie> is it a recursive CTE
