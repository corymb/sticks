[04:10:55] <toddpratt> but the only way to diagnose it positively is via autopsy
[04:11:09] <toddpratt> that's unhelpful
[04:11:11] <Pici> from what?
[04:11:20] <wleslie> life
[04:11:28] <Pici> I know what an autopsy is.
[04:11:44] <wleslie> "banging your head against a wall
[04:11:45] <wleslie> "
[04:12:13] <toddpratt> various head injuries
[04:12:23] <Pici> :/
[04:12:27] <toddpratt> weren't no bike helmets in the '80s
[04:13:09] <wleslie> oh.  sorry toddpratt.  that's sucky.
[04:13:21] <toddpratt> if there were, my mom would probably be like, "I'm not buying you any more.  You just keep breaking them."
[04:25:49] <wleslie> I can't tell if my blue cheese has gone moldy
[04:39:46] <kosh> toddpratt, that is okay I am willing to cut open your head to see where the problem is
[05:12:13] <toddpratt> yes
[05:12:37] <toddpratt> kosh: when?
[05:13:39] <toddpratt> not recently
[05:13:42] <toddpratt> damn
[05:15:02] <kosh> well there are probably going to be some side effects
[05:15:51] <toddpratt> i knew you'd lose your nerve
[05:16:11] <kosh> I also don't live remotely near you

[05:25:23] <ldlework> New favorite past time: Hyping VR to all my gamer friends who are also parents.
[05:25:38] <kosh> why parents?
[05:31:26] <kosh> hmm games "journalists" are very strange it seems they keep saying that elder scrolls 6 will be out next year or that it won't be out and all kinds of reasons why
[05:31:55] <kosh> and bethesda flat out said it was still in design phase and was in design phase since shortly after fallout 4 and it will be another few years before it comes out since it takes a long time to write these games
